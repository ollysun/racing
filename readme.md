Mountain Bike Race Tracking System
This application is designed to track mountain bike races, riders, and race results. The system also integrates with weather services to fetch real-time weather conditions for race locations. It allows users to create and manage races, riders, and results while also generating useful reports such as top 3 riders, riders who did not finish, and those who did not participate in the race.
